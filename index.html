            <h4 style="color: black; font-weight: bold; font-size: 120%;">Your pulse, both at rest and during exercise,
                can reveal your risk for heart attack and your aerobic
                capacity!</h4>
            A healthy heart doesn't beat with the regularity of clockwork. It speeds up and slows down to accommodate
            your changing need for oxygen as your activities vary throughout the day. A "normal" heart rate varies from
            person to person. However, an unusually high resting heart rate or low maximum heart rate may signify an
            increased risk of heart disease or other medical condition.
            <br>
            When you are at rest, your heart is pumping the lowest amount of blood to supply the oxygen your body's
            needs. Although the official normal resting heart rate ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute, the range for
            most healthy adults is between 55 and 85 beats per minute.
            <br>
            <br>
            However, There is no specific good resting heart rate. Well-trained athletes can have numbers in the 40s.
            But a heart
            rate that slow for the average person would be concerning and should prompt a call to your doctor's office,
            especially if you felt weak, lightheaded, or short of breath.
            <br><br>
            On the other end of the scale, a resting heart rate that is consistently above 90 beats per minute is also
            something your doctor should be aware of. Although it is still formally still normal, it could be a clue of
            something amiss, but not necessarily a serious problem.

            <h2>Relationship Between Blood Pressure and Health</h2>

        <div class="agepara">
            <p>
                Abnormal blood pressure and an aging population have become one of the major public health problems
                facing the world1–3. Overall, 30.71% (≈ 323.6 million) of Chinese adult ≥ 65 years of age had
                high-normal blood pressure (HNBP) between 2012 and 20154. The Healthy China Action (2019–2030) issued by
                the National Health and Wellness Committee in 2019 emphasizes that primary medical and health
                institutions should have the ability to provide standardized health management services for hypertension
                patients within their jurisdiction.
                <br><br>
                When we think about how blood pressure can adversely affect health, the focus is primarily on
                hypertension. That refers to blood pressure that is higher than normal. Having high blood pressure
                increases someone's risk of developing heart disease and of having a stroke. Each of these is a leading
                cause of death in the U.S. But having blood pressure that is lower than normal, which is known as
                hypotension, can have a negative impact on health, as well. When blood pressure drops too far, the
                tissues of the body begin to develop a deficit of oxygen. This can cause symptoms that range from mild
                to severe. A substantial or sustained drop in blood pressure can be life-threatening.
                <br><br>
                High blood pressure increases the risk of heart diseases, stroke, kidney disease, and dementia. In
                addition, if the blood pressure remains constantly high, your blood vessels may weaken and eventually
                lead to narrow blood vessels and clots. High blood pressure is dangerous because it makes our body work
                harder to pump blood into the body. Although it’s rare high blood pressure may lead to bursting of the
                blood vessels or even heart failure.
                <br><br>
                People who consume a lot of salt, are smokers, or don’t exercise are more prone to high blood pressure.
                High blood pressure has a lot to do with our family history. Aging can also be a reason for high blood
                pressure, which not many people know about. Having health issues like diabetes, kidney disease, or high
                cholesterol can double the risk of high blood pressure.

            <h2>Common Health Conditions associated with ageing!</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="agepara">
            <p>
                Common conditions in older age include hearing loss, cataracts and refractive errors, back and neck pain
                and osteoarthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, depression and dementia. As people
                age, they are more likely to experience several conditions at the same time.
                Older age is also characterized by the emergence of several complex health states commonly called
                geriatric syndromes. They are often the consequence of multiple underlying factors and include frailty,
                urinary incontinence, falls, delirium and pressure ulcers.
                <br><br>
                A considerable number of studies have examined the impact of age stereotypes or subjective aging on
                health-related outcomes. Experimental studies investigated the transient impact of a short-term
                activation of age stereotypes or subjective age on health-related outcomes, whereas longitudinal
                observational studies showed the long-term impact of VoA. In addition, a number of cross-sectional
                studies exist on the relation of VoA and health-related outcomes. However, the following sections focus
                on experimental and longitudinal observational studies, because they are better suited to speak to the
                causality and directionality of effects.
                <br><br>
                There is no typical older person. Some 80-year-olds have physical and mental capacities similar to many
                30-year-olds. Other people experience significant declines in capacities at much younger ages. A
                comprehensive public health response must address this wide range of older people’s experiences and
                needs.
                <br><br>
                The diversity seen in older age is not random. A large part arises from people’s physical and social
                environments and the impact of these environments on their opportunities and health behaviour. The
                relationship we have with our environments is skewed by personal characteristics such as the family we
                were born into, our sex and our ethnicity, leading to inequalities in health.
